      Incrementally loaded fact table of [environment agency readings](https://environment.data.gov.uk/flood-monitoring/doc/reference#introduction) (river levels, rainfall, etc.).
      One row per reading per measure. New readings are appended on each dbt run from the
      API's `?latest` endpoint. This is the only persistent store of readings history --
      the staging layer is a snapshot that gets overwritten each run.
